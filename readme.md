The Tower of Cipher Breaking: A Graph Adventure Game


Project Title and Description:

The Tower of Cipher Breaking is an interactive adventure game that combines huffman codes and pathfinding to create an engaging puzzle-solving experience. In this project, players journey through multiple levels, each presenting a unique challenge involving graph traversal, Huffman tree decoding. The game consists of 3 levels:

Huffman Tree Level - Decode a message using a Huffman Tree to save a person trapped in a tower.

Graph Level 1 - Traverse a graph using BFS, aiming to reach nodes with minimum cost.

Graph Level 2 - Find optimal paths using Dijkstra with weights, incorporating hints to ensure success.
